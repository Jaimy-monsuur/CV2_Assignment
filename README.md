# CV2_Assignment
A movie belongs to more than one genre, right? It doesn’t belong to a single category, like action or comedy or thrill. The movie has a combination of two or more genres, so it is not a binary or multi class classification problem. For CV 2 assignment, students are required to predict multiple labels(genre) of a movie using its poster image. The dataset they’ll be using contain the poster images of several multi-genre movies. Below are a few posters from the dataset.

The dataset can be downloaded from here Movie Genre Classification (ccu.edu.tw)  or laxmimerit/Movies-Poster_Dataset: Movies Poster Dataset for Multi-Label Image Classification (github.com) . Students have to develop a neural network that inputs a movie poster and outputs its genres.
